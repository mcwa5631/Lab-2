    <h1>Best Recent Reading - Jack McWatt</h1>
    <p>
    <blockquote> best thing I have read recently is Vladmir Guerroro Jr.'s biography on wikipedia. <br>
        I have a Toronto Blue Jays fan and my current favourite player is Vladdy. I enjoy reading <br>
        about Baseball players because I find it interesting to see their background and where <br>
        they came from. </blockquote>

    <blockquote>Reading about their challenges gets me to understand the player better, <br>
        Vladdy's was especially interesting because he is my favourite player right now so reading <br>
        about his life in the Dominican Republic was interesting.</blockquote>
